  abstract = {We present a theoretical study of the effect of radiation losses on the mode selectivity of DFB lasers with second-order gratings. For a second-order grating, interference of the radiation due to first-order diffraction of oppositely propagating guided waves cancels the radiation loss at one of the edges of the spectrum gap. This provides threshold gain discrimination of order 10 cm-1against one of the two dominant modes occurring near the edges of the gap. This should allow fabrication of DFB lasers with properties that are nearly independent of the positions of the facets relative to the grating corrugations, which are uncontrolled. By applying antireflection coatings to the two ends, differential quantum efficiencies close to those of conventional Fabry-Perot lasers should be achievable.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an all-solution fabrication approach for external second-order 1D distributed feedback (DFB) gratings using soft UV-nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL) above archetypical methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite films. This high-throughput method can be carried out in an ambient environment and requires only slightly elevated temperatures as low as 70 \textdegree C, gentle imprint pressure, and the use of compatible UV-NIL resin. Under stripe-shaped optical excitation, we observe simultaneously occurring optical phenomena in our high-gain strong-scattering perovskite films, namely amplified spontaneous emission, random lasing, and 1D DFB lasing. In pursuit of distinguishing these mechanisms, we explore far-field emission patterns and output polarization. Additionally, the DFB lasing is hardly attenuated when a thin absorbing indium tin oxide (ITO) film, commonly used as an electrode in fully contacted electrical devices, is inserted between the perovskite film and the DFB grating. As a result, we reproducibly achieve single and multimode, low-threshold (below 100 {$\mu$}J{$\cdot$}cm\textendash 2), narrow linewidth (below 0.2 nm), and strongly polarized (extinction ratio above 50) optically pumped DFB lasing for MAPbI3 waveguides with and without an adjacent ITO layer. We believe that the proposed resonator integration approach can be extended toward complete electrically active devices, enabling an alternative integration scheme to achieve current-injection lasing.}
