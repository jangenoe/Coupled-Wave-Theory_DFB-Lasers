# Introduction

This jupyter book applies the calculations of Kogelnik and Shank in J. Appl. Phys. 43, 2327 (1972) {cite:p}`kogelnikCoupledWaveTheory1972` to a few use cases. 
The calculations have been validated by replotting the graphs from {cite:p}`kogelnikCoupledWaveTheory1972`.
Each of the chapters elaborates one use case.

The online version allows to recalculate all graphs in [jupyter-lite](https://jangenoe.github.io/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers/Lite) (even without any code installed).

All code is available on [Github](https://github.com/jangenoe/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers)
