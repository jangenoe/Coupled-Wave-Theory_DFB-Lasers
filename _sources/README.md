# Distributed Feedback Lasers

This repository applies the calculations of Kogelnik and Shank in J. Appl. Phys. 43, 2327 (1972) [1] to a few use cases. 
The calculations have been validated by replotting the graphs from [1].

This repository comprises:
* The [code](https://github.com/jangenoe/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers)
* The web based [jupyterbook](https://jangenoe.github.io/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers)
* The pdf of the [jupyterbook](https://jangenoe.github.io/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers.pdf)
* The [Jupyter-Lite environment](https://jangenoe.github.io/Coupled-Wave-Theory_DFB-Lasers/Lite) enabling to recalculation online without installation of any python code on your PC.
